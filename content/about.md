<br>
I've started this website to share few things I've learnt and still learning about computer science, mathematics and all this realted to STEM. I am a happy husband thanks to my wonderful wife and a busy father with my lovely daugther.
:sweat_smile:

BTW I am looking for a better job, I am curently working for GE in Paris, France so if you are a large company with complex problem related to cloud and distributed computing, you have a link to my twitter profile or linkedin profile.
