I've started this website to share few things I've learnt and still learning about computer science, mathematics things realted to STEM and ADHD. Yes I do have ADHD, this is my secret super power. I am a happy husband thanks to my wonderful wife and a busy father with my lovely daugther :sweat_smile: .
I am not looking for job for now, as I've just changed couples month ago, but if you work with cloud and have complex problem related to scalability and distributed computing, you have a link to my twitter or linkedin profile.
