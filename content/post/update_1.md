# Health
It's been a long time since I have given some news. 
During 2020, I took a lot of time to get properly diagnosed.
In the end, all the errands have come to an end. I have ADHD,
and a very weird IQ. So I am very very good in certain things
and less effective some other things. At the end I am average like
most people that are doing my kind of job. Well, after couples 
of months taking some medicine ðŸ’Š, things have improved but not 
the point I was expecting. I guess some tunings are still needed.
The bad things about being diagnosed this late, even if 
finally understand why you feel some tired or bored after
doing some tasks, you need to re-learn a lot of things. 
Until recently my to-do lists were messy and planning ahead of time
was a nightmare. So I tried something derived from bujo and so far
so good. I forget a lot less, I work less but since things
are way better organize I end up doing more. Is that 
awesome! I hope, I can keep doing those rigourous planning
session...

#Job Update
As side note in mid 2021, someone decided that my whole team
was not needed anymore. Thank you dear financial department and 
share holders. Did this bad news worried me, well not that much I got 
two very good job proposal in less than three months.
So now I am doing a little bit more *k8s* than before but things
are not done in a very *DevOps* friendly way. In the end there is 
more team and organisational improvements to be done before addressing deep technical
issues. The ultimate good news, this job is 95% *remote* !
So in the end a big thank you dear financial department, because my new job
is better than the one I used to have.

#What's coming
I have a couple of ongoing subject I want to write about.
The first one, is *golang* my new favorite weapon in my
arsenal, second one is *c++* still a good choice for modern applications.
The last but note least is of course, *performance improvement* and *monitoring*.
So wait for the next post.
